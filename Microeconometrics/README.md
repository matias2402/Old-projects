This folder contains the code used to answer the Winter 2022/2023 Microeconometrics Exam

In it we solve a binary model for panel data and cross sectional data, using maximum likelihood and quadrature and simulated maximum likelihood. It also contains another project where we have used the LASSO estimator.
